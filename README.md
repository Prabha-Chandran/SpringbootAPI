The CRUD stands for Create, Read/Retrieve, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic functions of the persistence storage.

The CRUD operation can be defined as user interface conventions that allow view, search, and modify information through computer-based forms and reports. CRUD is data-oriented and the standardized use of HTTP action verbs. HTTP has a few important verbs.

**POST: Creates a new resource
GET: Reads a resource
PUT: Updates an existing resource
DELETE: Deletes a resource**
